const text = `Hey there! Sam here. Thanks for visiting! Here's some more info about me.

I studied Bioresource Science & Engineering, formerly known as Paper Science Engineering, an ABET-accredited engineering program at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA.

I also went overseas with five others to lead English talking clubs at college and universities in a country with little to no access to native English speakers.

And although all of the above came with challenges and problems to solve, I was never excited to wake up and solve the dayâ€™s problems.

That is, until I enrolled in BloomTech's (formerly known as Lambda School) Full Stack Web Development program. There, I went to a fully-remote classroom every weekday fulltime, learning web development on the front end using React and Redux, configuring back end Express, Node.js, and Django servers, querying noSQL and SQL relational databases like MongoDB and Knex, as well as learning C to build CPUs and queues.

I was a Software Engineer at NewPoint Media, a real estate and integrated marketing company in Austin, TX, with the goal of combining print and technology for the best home buying experience from December 2018 to March 2020.

Until recently, I was part of the engineering team at Volusion, an ecommerce platform based in Austin, TX, working as a Backend Engineer.
